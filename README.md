## How to run this react app?
- First, clone this project 
- Once cloned, using the terminal on your computer enter ``` npm install ```. This will fetch all the files needed for react to execute this app.
- Then, enter this command ``` npm install @material-ui/core ```. This will fetch all the files needed for Material-UI.
- After this you can execute the app. For that enter this command ``` npm start ```.

### Note:
- The app is still under development, I intend to improve it more by adding more animations, features and improving its current performance.
- There are some bugs that I soon intend to fix.
